## 3. Guardrails
- Warn for missing/empty sections.
- Flag short sections (<50 words).
- Prevent hallucinations; only use provided text.
- Chunk long papers by section boundaries.
- Ensure equations and citations are only from text.
- Strict Evidence Mode
  * Add flag evidence_mode = "strict".
  * In strict mode: only use claims/results explicitly found in text.
  * If insufficient info: output a message (e.g., “Not enough detail for strict evidence summary.”).
- Standardized Section Warnings
  * Missing/empty section → output “Section skipped: no usable text provided.”
  * Too short (<50 words) → output “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”
